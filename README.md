# Movie-Recommender
This project develops a movie recommender system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users. The system uses hybrid filtering techniques to analyze user preferences and viewing habits to recommend movies that users will likely enjoy.

**DATASET:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
Implemented hybrid filtering that combined collaborative and content based filtering to improve
recommendation and user satisfaction.

Enhanced a movie recommendation system by leveraging feature extraction (TfidfVectorizer, CounVectorizer)
and Python libraries (scikit-learn, Pandas, surprise), resulting in improved accuracy.
